# LMS Integration - TAFTA Registration Flow

## Overview

This implementation provides a unified user experience where users can use the same email and password for both the TAFTA dashboard and the Thinkific LMS platform.

## New User Flow

1. **User Registration** → Creates account on both TAFTA dashboard and Thinkific LMS
2. **Email Verification** → User clicks verification link in email
3. **Dual Redirect** → Current tab goes to personal information form, new tab opens LMS sign-in
4. **LMS Access** → User signs into Thinkific with same credentials

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Modified Signup Process (`pages/api/auth/signup.ts`)
- Creates Thinkific user immediately during registration
- Uses plain text password for Thinkific (before hashing for dashboard)
- Stores `thinkific_user_id` in database
- Automatically adds user to cohort group on Thinkific

### 2. Updated Email Verification Pages
- `pages/verify-email.tsx` - Opens TAFTA portal sign-in in new tab, redirects current tab to personal information
- `pages/verify-email-new.tsx` - Consistent behavior with main verification page

### 3. Modified Role-Based Routing (`pages/role.tsx`)
- Verified users without enrollments → Personal information form
- Verified users with enrollments → TAFTA portal sign-in
- Unverified users → Email verification

### 4. Direct TAFTA Portal Redirect
- Users are redirected directly to https://portal.terraacademyforarts.com/users/sign_in
- No local LMS sign-in page needed
- Users can sign in with their dashboard credentials
- Seamless access to learning platform

## Configuration Required

### Environment Variables
Add to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Thinkific Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_THINKIFIC_SUBDOMAIN=your-school-name

# Existing Thinkific API configuration
API_KEY=your_thinkific_api_key
API_SUBDOMAIN=your_thinkific_subdomain
```

### Thinkific Subdomain
Replace `your-school-name` with your actual Thinkific subdomain (e.g., if your LMS URL is `https://tafta.thinkific.com`, use `tafta`).

## User Experience Flow

```
Registration → Email Verification → Dual Redirect → LMS Access
     ↓              ↓                    ↓              ↓
Dashboard    Verify Email Page    New Tab: LMS    Thinkific LMS
Account      (Current Tab:        Sign-In         (Same Credentials)
             Personal Info)       Current Tab:
                                  Personal Info
```

## Benefits

✅ **Unified Credentials**: Same email/password for both platforms  
✅ **Seamless Experience**: No need to remember multiple passwords  
✅ **Immediate Access**: Users can access LMS right after verification  
✅ **Consistent Flow**: Clear progression through registration steps  
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if Thinkific integration fails  
✅ **Welcome Emails**: Users receive Thinkific welcome emails automatically  
✅ **Complete Enrollment**: Automatic course enrollment after form submission  

## Technical Implementation

### Thinkific API Endpoints Used
- `POST /users` - Create user account
- `POST /enrollments` - Enroll user in courses
- `POST /group_users` - Add user to cohort groups

### Database Changes
- `thinkific_user_id` field stores the Thinkific user identifier
- Used for enrollment synchronization and group management

### Error Handling
- If Thinkific user creation fails, local user creation continues
- Users can still complete registration even if LMS integration has issues
- Comprehensive logging for debugging integration problems

## Testing

1. **Registration Flow**: Test complete user registration
2. **Email Verification**: Verify redirect to personal information form
3. **LMS Integration**: Confirm Thinkific user creation and group assignment
4. **Credential Consistency**: Test login with same credentials on both platforms

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Thinkific API errors**: Check API key and subdomain configuration
- **User creation failures**: Verify Thinkific API permissions
- **Group assignment issues**: Ensure cohort names match exactly
- **No welcome emails**: Ensure `send_welcome_email: true` is included in user creation
- **No enrollment**: Check that users complete the final submission step

### Debug Steps
1. Check browser console for API errors
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Test Thinkific API endpoints directly
4. Review server logs for detailed error information
5. Check that users click "Complete Registration" button on final step
6. Verify automatic enrollment API is being called

### Fixed Issues
- ✅ **Missing welcome emails**: Added `send_welcome_email: true` to Thinkific user creation
- ✅ **Missing enrollment**: Added submit button and automatic enrollment trigger to EndOfApplication
- ✅ **Incomplete registration**: Users now get proper completion flow with enrollment
- ✅ **Enrollment debugging**: Added comprehensive logging to track enrollment process
- ✅ **Course data extraction**: Enhanced course data retrieval from profile and sessionStorage
- ✅ **Fallback enrollment**: Added backup enrollment creation in EndOfApplication component
